The solution depends on the specific error. Common approaches:
1. **Check Expo CLI version:** Ensure it's updated using `expo upgrade`.
2. **Examine logs:** Carefully review the complete error logs for clues (often pointing to a specific dependency or configuration problem).
3. **Verify package.json:** Double-check for dependency conflicts or outdated packages. Use `npm install` or `yarn install` to update.
4. **Review app.json:** Check for any typos or inconsistencies in your app configuration. Make sure that all the necessary fields are provided and correct.
5. **Check native modules:** If using native modules, ensure they are correctly linked and configured. Review their documentation for specific instructions.
6. **Clean and rebuild:** Sometimes, a clean build can resolve temporary issues. Try `expo prebuild` or deleting the `.expo` and `node_modules` directories, then reinstalling packages.
7. **Consult Expo documentation and community forums:** Search for similar error messages in the Expo documentation or community forums.  This may reveal solutions or workarounds from other developers.
